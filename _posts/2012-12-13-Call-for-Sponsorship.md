#Call for JVM-support Sponsorships

Background
----------
In June we started a [survey of interest](http://localhost:4000/2012/06/13/Calabash_JVM_Support/) in Java/JVM support for writing and executing Calabash tests. In the last 6 months we've been speaking at conferences and talking to customers, and JVM support has been a recurring feature request. Our survey for JVM support has now been answered by a number of larger companies all positive around sponsoring JVM support.

So now is the time!

Sponsorships
-------------------------------
We now have sufficient interest from several larger companies that need JVM support and have indicated interest in sponsoring the development effort.

We've estimated a total cost of $10.000 for us for this development effort. LessPainful itself will sponsor 25% of the effort since it benefits Calabash -- this leaves $7500 that we need to find.

Benefits for sponsors

- Of course, using Java for writing Calabash tests is the most obvious benefit.

- All sponsors have the option of having their logo added as a sponsor to the Calabash landing page ([http://calaba.sh](http://calaba.sh)).

- All sponsors have the option of being mentioned (including the amount sponsored) in an appreciation blog post and tweets by [@lesspainful](http://twitter.com/lesspainful).

- Any special JVM feature requests are possible and will be seriously considered for sponsors.

Please let us know if you want to contribute to this effort.

Deadline
---------
*Deadline* for accepting is *December 21st 2012* (if you want to sponsor but cannot fully confirm by 21st, let us know, and we will figure something out).

Please contact [contact@lesspainful.com](mailto:contact@lesspainful.com) to become a sponsor.

After the deadline we will post here whether or not the goal has been reached.
