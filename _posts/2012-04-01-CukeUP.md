Speaking about Calabash at Cukeup! 2012
---------------------------------------

Things are going well with Calabash - it's starting to come alive! People are [picking it up](http://alblue.bandlem.com/2012/03/nsconf-day-3.html), they [ask questions](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/calabash-android/RkorIjABAtg/Z3vOXDSGDjUJ), [post feature requests](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/2) and [get excited](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nativedriver-users/atbX8EK0NG0/lW8zCuGHao8J). (as are we!)

Thats cool! But we want to spread the word even more. I've already given talks at [QCon London 2012](http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/KarlKrukow_CalabashAnOpenSourceAutomatedTestingTechnologyForNativeMobile.pdf), [Goto Night, Amsterdam](https://secure.trifork.com/amsterdam-2012/freeevent/index.jsp?eventOID=4054) and [Code motion Rome](http://www.codemotion.it/en/talk/calabash-open-source-automated-testing-technology-native-mobile).

Next up is Cuke!, and I'm very excited about this one. Cucumber powers Calabash, so I'm happy to give something back to the community. I'll be giving a talk about Calabash at [Cukeup! 2012](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/cukeup-2012/ac-3691) Wed. April 4 at 14.15 - 14.45. Hope to see you there!
