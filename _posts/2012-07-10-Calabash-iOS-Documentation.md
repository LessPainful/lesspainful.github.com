Documentation for Calabash iOS
------------------------------

I've done some work to document the previously undocumented API functions needed to write custom steps. I've also given the documentation an update in general. It is actually getting fairly good (let me know if you disagree!).

Checkout these highlights:

[Documentation Overview](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/00-Documentation-overview)

[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/01-Getting-started-guide)

[Ruby API](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/03.5-Calabash-iOS-Ruby-API)

[Touch/Event Recording and Playback](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/04-Touch-recording-and-playback)

[Web View/Hybrid Support](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/06-WebView-Support)

And finally:

[EVERYTHING](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki).

I'll be complementing these with upcoming screencasts covering: How to work efficiently with Calabash iOS, Tool support, Ruby Tips and Advanced Touch Synthesis.

Stay tuned :)
