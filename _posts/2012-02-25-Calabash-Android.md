An Overview of Calabash Android
-------------------------
This post describes [Calabash Android](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-android) in some technical detail. It will give you an architectural overview and compare Calabash Android. It assumes that you  are familiar with [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) and Android development).

- For an introduction to Calabash and LessPainful (and some info on Cucumber), please read [Calabash: Functional Testing for Mobile Apps](...).
- Instructions for how to use Calabash in your Android project can be found on [Github](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-android).


Calabash Android Architecture
-----------------------------
When a Calabash Android test is executed both your local computer and a device is involed. The device might an emulator or a actual physical device.
It looks somethings like this:

- Features. The feature files describe the user-stories you want to test. You can test one or more features in one test run.

- Step Definitions. Calabash Android comes with a set of predefined step which you can find [here](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android/blob/master/features/step_definitions/canned_steps.md). These steps are generic and made to get you up and running fast. 
When you get more into Calabash you can implement your own custom steps that use the business terms your project uses like `I transfer money to my spendings account` or `I play "Never Gonna Give You Up"`.

- Your app. You don't have to make modifications to your app before testing it.

- Instrumentation Test Server. This is another app that will be installed and executed the device. This app is based on `ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2` from the Android SDK. It is generated by the Calabash Android framework.


Functional Testing tools for Android
------------------------------------
The Android SDK comes with a testing framework located in the `android.test`. [According to Google](http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/testing/helloandroid_test.html) it is easy to use. However, I'm pretty sure that the person who wrote that either never wrote and maintained a test using `ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2` or has totally misunderstood the "easy to use" concept.

When [Renas Reda](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/renas-reda/25/70a/932) created [Robotium](www.robotium.org) things became a lot easier. Robotium is a utility that handles a lot of the small details you really don't want to be concerned about in a functional test. You are still writing your test using Java and JUnit but a lot of the very annoying things from vanilla Android testing. Today all the Android projects that I know of that do any kind of testing use Robotium (or Calabash). So if you are still fighting `android.test` and want to clean up your tests you should give Robotium a try and send Renas a happy thought.

Even when using Robotium my experience from several large Android projects is that writing functional testing in Java is just wrong. Over time the ever growing test suite because more and more complicated and takes more and more resources to maintain. But hey! Why wouldn't it be like that? That is exactly the same experience we had when writing functional test for websites!

And that's why you should give [Calabash Android](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-android) a try.
