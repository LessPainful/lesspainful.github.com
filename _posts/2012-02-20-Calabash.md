Calabash: Functional Testing for Mobile Apps
--------------------------------------------

Jonas and I(*should this be LessPainful?*) are proud to release
Calabash, a new functional testing tool for mobile apps based on
[Cucumber](http://cukes.info). LessPainful has been developing
Calabash over the last year pursuing its expressive power, simplicity
and stability. Calabash is the technology that powers device
automation and test execution at
[LessPainful](http://www.lesspainful.com), but as of today it is
released as open source to the general public:
[http://github.com/calabash](http://github.com/calabash).

### The short story

The following sections are introductory, and describe Calabash in more
detail for people who don't already know Cucumber, or who
haven't been looking at functional testing for mobile apps. If that
doesn't apply to you, you can go to the <a href="#rationale">Rationale
and Benefits</a> section. If you're into the tech stuff, you could
jump to the hardcore technical info in our detail posts about
[Calabash Android](http://blog.lesspainful.com/...) and
[Calabash iOS](http://blog.lesspainful.com/...), or you can even dive
right into the sources:
[calabash-android](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-android) and
[calabash-ios](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios).

### Introducing Calabash

Calabash consists of two libraries
[calabash-android](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-android) and
[calabash-ios](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios). As you can
imagine, calabash-android is the automation and testing library for
Android, and similarly calabash-ios is for iOS.

Calabash can be considered the underlying low-level libraries that
empower the Cucumber tool to run automated functional tests on
non-jailbroken Android and iOS phones and tablets as well as on
simulators. These low-level libraries enable QA, business staff and
developers to work at a high level: they write tests in a natural
language using the terms and concepts of their business domain. For
example, here is part of a test written with Calabash.

    Feature: Rating a stand
      Scenario: Find and rate a stand from the list
        Given I am on the List
        Then I should see a "rating" button
        And I should not see "Dixie Burger & Gumbo Soup"
        And take picture

        Then I touch the "rating" button
        And I should see "Dixie Burger & Gumbo Soup"
        And take picture

        When I touch "Dixie Burger & Gumbo Soup"
        Then I should see details for "Dixie Burger & Gumbo Soup"

        When I touch the "rate_it" button
        Then I should see the rating panel

        Then I touch "star5"
        And I touch "rate"
        And take picture

If you don't already know [Cucumber](http://cukes.info), it may
surprise you that this description is actually an executable test
specification that is part of a test suite for an iPhone app!

In Cucumber and Calabash, one defines so-called feature files, that
describe the intended behaviour of the app. You can think of a feature
file as an executable test specification of a use case of the app. In
our example above, the app contains functionality for rating a food
stand at [Roskilde Festival](http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/). A
feature consists of one or more scenarios, corresponding more or less
to the possible outcomes of the use cases. In our simple example we
have only one scenario the "sunshine" scenario where we find a stand
and rate it five stars. There would usually also be scenarios testing
other things, e.g., error scenarios. Finally, each scenario consists
of a number of steps. The usual form of a feature is:

    Feature: name...
      Scenario: ...
        Step
        Step
        ...

      Scenario: ...
        Step
        Step
        ...


In our example, each line after "Scenario"
corresponds to a step. In calabash, a step does one of three things:
takes a user action (like touch, swipe, scroll, etc.), makes an
assertion (like `Then I should see details for ".."`) or takes a
screen-shot. The screen-shot step takes a snapshot of how your
application looks at the point in the test. Screenshots can then be
inspected for graphical errors that are hard to catch using
assertions. Also, comparing screenshots across many different Android
or iOS devices and operating system can be really useful. This type of visual test report, is part of what the [LessPainful Service](http://www.lesspainful.com) offers. You can see an example our feature for the Roskilde app above in the <a href="#LessPainful">LessPainful section</a>.

### Rationale and Benefits

Why create a new open source functional test library? There are several reasons.

<dl>
 <dt>Uniform interface across platforms</dt>
 <dd>We wanted a single interface for
    specifying the behaviour of mobile apps across platforms. Many
    companies are creating the same app (or <em>almost</em> the same app) for
    both iOS and Android, and pay double costs when it comes to
    testing. With Calabash, you have the option of maintaining
    only one feature file per app use-case, even if you are
    developing for both Android and iOS. The platform or app
    differences can be factored out into so-called <em>step definitions</em>
    which are different per platform. (If you're thinking Windows Phone? Then, yes, it is an option, but we haven't gotten round to it yet ;)
 </dd>
 <dt>Cucumber</dt>
 <dd>We wanted a high-level, domain-centric language for specification. The Cucumber technology gives us this. A Cucumber feature file can be written by QA, domain experts or developers; developers or technical test staff can then write step definitions to realize the steps on each platform (possibly using one of the many predefined steps or APIs).</dd>
 <dt>Authenticity</dt>
 <dd>We wanted a test automation technology that is as authentic as possible. Test must be able to run equally well on physical, non-jailbroken devices as on simulators. The <a href="#LessPainful">LessPainful Service</a> takes this to the next level, by providing a test execution environment for running tests concurrently on many different devices (we even do <a href="">rotation using little robots!</a>).
 </dd>
 <dt>Expressive power</dt>
 <dd>There are some cool functional testing technologies out there already (like Robotium, Frank, KIF, Zucchini and UIAutomation). However, in our opinion each of them have advantages and disadvantages, and none of them fulfilled our needs completely (see details in the blog posts <a href="#">Calabash Android</a> and <a href="#">Calabash iOS</a>. We wanted a technology with expressive power: support for complex gestures (swipes, pinch, etc), embedded webviews, rotation, backgrounding ... all while running on non-jailbroken devices.
 </dd>
 <dt>Extensibility and Community</dt>
 <dd>This is part of the reason why we are open sourcing Calabash. We want you to test your apps and ship better quality. We want Calabash users to be able to extend Calabash itself, and we want to build an open source community that is enthusiastic about the technology.

### LessPainful

What is the role of [LessPainful](http://www.lesspainful.com) in
regard to Calabash, and what services do we provide?

LessPainful is the founder of Calabash, and we are its core
committers. Calabash tests can be run "in the cloud" using the
LessPainful service. The service automates running tests concurrently
on several physical, non-jailbroken Android and iOS phones and
tablets. We support several operating system versions and device
language and regional settings.

The LessPainful service provides visual test reports. This lets you
easily compare test results and the visual appearance of your app
across different devices. Here is an example test report from our sample food stand app:

<a href="img/test_report_overview.png">
<img src="img/test_report_large.png" title="Test report overview" alt="Test report overview">
</a>


The LessPainful Service is designed to support continuous integration
providing a web service for running tests with every commit or at
least on a daily basis.
